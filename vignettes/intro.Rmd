## Rolling a Dice
This package simulates tossing a coin(or device), a specific number of times. From there, the relative frequencies are calculated and a plot of the series is displayed.

##Creating the Device
To create your own device, you must create the dice object. To do this, use the function device().

```{r}
new_device <- device()
new_device
```

By default, 'device()' will create a fair coin with standard sides of 1 and 2, and probabilities of 0.5.
To change this, you must use the arguments 'sides' and 'prob'
```{r}
load_dice <- device(sides = c("heads", "tails"), prob = c(0.9, 0.1))
```
